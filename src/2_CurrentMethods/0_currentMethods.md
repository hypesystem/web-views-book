==============

We could add a timeline here, talking about the web:

- 1989: World Wide Web was created.
  It consisted of HTML pages, all written by hand, and put online.
  They were transferred via the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
- 1998: After some experiments with web pages that change based on data on disk, PHP 3 was released this year.
  PHP has been the most popular language for quickly writing interactive websites.
  PHP can be written in-line on websites, making it easy to hand-write pages, while still making them dynamic/change based on user requests.
  Of course, there were many other languages and tools that allowed for interaction in websites, as well.
- 2005: Ruby on Rails was released.
  Ruby on Rails is a Model-View-Controller web framework.
  It abstracts away a lot of things and makes modern web development easy.
  Ruby on Rails is probably one of the most popular web frameworks today and has been imitated in many other languages than Ruby.
  The significant thing to note about frameworks like this is that pages are per-default dynamically generated on request.
- 2008: Development started on Jekyll, a static page generator.
  Jekyll uses version control as a content-management system, allowing users to write static pages that only change on deployment.
  It helps with templating, making it a significant step above what was first available on the world wide web, but with the same advantage of *speed* (server-side processing is pretty non-existant).
